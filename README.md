# Echothis - CSI Linux Operations Repository

Welcome to the **Echothis** repository! This is your go-to source for everything related to CSI Linux’s immersive simulations, training content, and digital operations. This repository brings together the **Compendium**, templates, labs, storylines, twines, and a treasure trove of media assets (images and videos) to enhance your training and operational workflows.

## Project Overview

Echothis serves as the backbone of our **cyber forensics** and **investigative simulations**. It integrates various interactive tools like **Twine SugarCube 2** and **H5P**, providing highly realistic scenarios across multiple domains: malware analysis, OSINT, digital forensics, dark web investigations, and more.

### What's Inside?

- **Compendium & Storylines:** The heart of Echothis—rich narrative content designed for engaging simulations with dynamic outcomes.
- **Twine Operations:** Choose from pre-built story-driven Twine scenarios to simulate real-world forensic investigations and cyber operations.
- **H5P Interactive Learning:** Boost your learning experience with quizzes, puzzles, and other interactive content.
- **Templates for Documentation:** Structured templates to streamline your creation of storylines, walkthroughs, reports, and SOPs.
- **Factions Catalog:** Explore the **owl-themed factions**, such as the **Assassins Guild** and **Financial Feathers**, for use in simulations.
- **Media Resources:** Access images, videos, and other multimedia assets generated with AI tools for educational use.

## Document Templates

The templates in this repository cover a variety of needs, from technical documentation to creative narrative development. These templates ensure consistency across operations, making content creation seamless.

- **Twine Operation Templates:** Standardized Twine files to maintain coherence across simulations.
- **Storyline Templates:** DOCX files to aid in narrative design, including sections for characters, plots, and cyber-forensic elements.
- **Technical Walkthroughs:** Templates to create manuals, instructional guides, and CSI Linux operational documentation.
- **SOPs:** Access structured procedures to ensure adherence to CSI Linux standards during content development.

## Labs and Simulations

The repository also houses multiple lab environments, simulations, and operations tailored to different areas of cyber forensics and investigative training. Each operation challenges learners with **story-driven missions** that parallel real-world events while providing immersive hands-on experience.
